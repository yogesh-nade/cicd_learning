# 🚨 Frontend Not Deploying? Troubleshooting Guide

## Step 1: Check if Netlify is Set Up

### ❓ **Do you have a Netlify site?**
- Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
- Do you see your site listed?
- If NO → Follow `NETLIFY-SETUP.md` first

## Step 2: Check GitHub Secrets

### ❓ **Are your secrets configured?**
1. Go to GitHub: **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Check if you have:
   - ✅ `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - ✅ `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
3. If NO → Get them from Netlify and add them

## Step 3: Check GitHub Actions

### ❓ **Did the workflow run?**
1. Go to GitHub Actions: https://github.com/yogesh-nade/cicd_learning/actions
2. Look for "Frontend CI/CD to Netlify" workflow
3. Check if it ran after your last push

### ❓ **Did it succeed or fail?**
- ✅ **Green checkmark** = Success, should be deployed
- ❌ **Red X** = Failed, click to see error details
- ⚪ **No workflow** = Didn't trigger (see Step 4)

## Step 4: Check Workflow Trigger

### ❓ **Were your changes in frontend/ folder?**
Your workflow only triggers on changes in `frontend/**`

**Example:**
- ✅ `frontend/src/App.js` → Triggers deployment
- ❌ `README.md` → Won't trigger frontend deployment
- ❌ `backend/server.js` → Won't trigger frontend deployment

## Step 5: Manual Deployment Test

### 🧪 **Test with a clear frontend change:**
1. Edit `frontend/src/App.js`:
   ```javascript
   <h1>📝 Notes App - TEST DEPLOYMENT v2.0</h1>
   ```
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add frontend/
   git commit -m "Test frontend deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Check GitHub Actions immediately
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

## Step 6: Check Netlify Dashboard

### ❓ **Is Netlify receiving deployments?**
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Check **Deploys** tab
3. Should see new deployment from GitHub

## 🆘 **Most Common Issue:**
**Missing Netlify Setup** - You need to:
1. Create Netlify site
2. Get auth token and site ID
3. Add them to GitHub Secrets

**Without these, the workflow will fail silently!**

## ✅ **Quick Check:**
What's your Netlify URL? If you don't have one, you need to complete Netlify setup first!
